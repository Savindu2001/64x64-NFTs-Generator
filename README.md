# Pixel NFT Generator

This code generates a simple pixel art image and saves it as a PNG file. It uses the Python Pillow library to create the image.

## About the Script

The script defines an image size (64x64 pixels) and sets each pixel in a checkerboard pattern using a loop. The resulting image is saved as `checkerboard.png`.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, etc.).
3. Copy and paste the code into the text editor.
4. Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `nft_generator.py`).
5. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
6. Run the command `python nft_generator.py` to execute the code.

The code will generate the pixel art image and save it to a file in the same directory as the Python file. You can then use this image to create an NFT using a platform like OpenSea or Rarible.

Note: You can replace the code with your own pixel art creation logic and adjust the image size to suit your needs.
